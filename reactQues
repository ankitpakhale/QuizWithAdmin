*	Abstract --> same action but different implementation, ex every car have speed but different different speed

*	Encapsulation --> Python provides access to all the variable and methods globally.
By using encapsulation, we can restrict the variables and methods acess globally by making it private or protected.
Single underscore _ --> protected
double underscore __ --> private
We can access protected variable outside of the class by creating the object of the class, but we can not access private variable outside of the class
Each class of python is encapsulated itself but the condition is data member should be restricted
